A set of super convenient keyboard layout schemata for the Esperanto language.


Homepage:

  https://github.com/jakwings/mac-keyboard-Esperanto


Installation:

  Just copy the file named Esperanto.bundle into your "~/Library/Keyboard Layouts" directory.
  ("~" is an alias for your home directory, so the explicit destination directory for a  
  user named "ada" would be "/Users/ada".)
  
  If you are using Finder to perform the copy, note that holding down your keyboard's 
  [option] key while hovering your mouse pointer over the "Go" option in Finder's menu bar
  will reveal the normally-hidden "Library" directory.

  If this is not your first time to install these keyboard layouts, remove the
  old layouts first. Next, logout and login again. Then reinstall.

  Finally, use System Preferences to add this layout . . .
  System Preferences -> Keyboard -> "Input Sources" tab

  Enjoy! :-)


Features:

  * Based on multiple layouts of the English Apple keyboards.
  
  * More latin letters from the combinations of accents and letters.
  
  * Support the x-system:
      c + x/X = ĉ, C + x/X = Ĉ
      g + x/X = ĝ, G + x/X = Ĝ
      h + x/X = ĥ, H + x/X = Ĥ
      j + x/X = ĵ, J + x/X = Ĵ
      s + x/X = ŝ, S + x/X = Ŝ
      u + x/X = ŭ, U + x/X = Ŭ
      
  * Use ESC or Tab or irrelevant keys to cancel any incomplete combination:
      c + Tab = c, C + Tab = C
      g + Tab = g, G + Tab = G
      h + Tab = h, H + Tab = H
      j + Tab = j, J + Tab = J
      s + Tab = s, S + Tab = S
      u + Tab = u, U + Tab = U
      S + u + g + a + r + c + o + a + t + i + n + g + . = Sugarcoating.
