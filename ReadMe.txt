A set of super convenient keyboard layout schemata for the Esperanto language.


Homepage:

  https://github.com/jakwings/mac-keyboard-Esperanto


Installation:

  Just drop Esperanto.bundle in the directory ~/Library/Keyboard Layouts
  "~" is your home directory. (e.g. /Users/ada)
  If this is not your first time to install these keyboard layouts, remove the
  old layouts first. Next, logout and login again. Finally, check the system
  preferences and add this layout. Enjoy! :-)


Features:

  * Based on multiplue layouts of the English Apple keyboards.
  * More latin letters from the combinations of accents and letters.
  * Support the x-system:
      c + x/X = ĉ, C + x/X = Ĉ
      g + x/X = ĝ, G + x/X = Ĝ
      h + x/X = ĥ, H + x/X = Ĥ
      j + x/X = ĵ, J + x/X = Ĵ
      s + x/X = ŝ, S + x/X = Ŝ
      u + x/X = ŭ, U + x/X = Ŭ
  * Use ESC or Tab or irrelevant keys to cancel any incomplete combination:
      c + Tab = c, C + Tab = C
      g + Tab = g, G + Tab = G
      h + Tab = h, H + Tab = H
      j + Tab = j, J + Tab = J
      s + Tab = s, S + Tab = S
      u + Tab = u, U + Tab = U
      S + u + g + a + r + c + o + a + t + i + n + g + . = Sugarcoating.
